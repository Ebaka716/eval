## Purpose
PromptLab exists to help professionals build practical AI prompting skills that translate to workplace value. It demystifies prompt chaining and agent workflows with hands-on, feedback-driven learning.

## Problems It Solves
- Fragmented learning resources with little structure or feedback
- Lack of clear evaluation standards for prompt quality
- Difficulty translating abstract prompting concepts into real workflows
- No longitudinal view of learner progress or capability growth

## How It Should Work
- Users select tasks and practice writing prompts (Evaluator)
- Users can design multi-step workflows (Prompt Builder)
- Outputs are structured (JSON) for dashboards and progress tracking
- Library of seeded tasks and few-shots ensures consistent outcomes

## User Experience Goals
- Clear, low-friction authoring experience for prompts and workflows
- Fast feedback cycles with actionable suggestions
- Transparent rubric and scoring with evidence
- Progress visualization (levels, badges, trendlines)
- Safe sandbox for experimentation and innovation
